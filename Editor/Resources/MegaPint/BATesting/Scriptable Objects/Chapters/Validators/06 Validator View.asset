  taskName: Validator View
  taskDescription: 'The Validator View is an essential part of the Validators package.
    This window acts as an overview over all validations in the whole project. The
    editor window contains two tabs, one to display all VMBs in the currently opened
    scenes and one to display all prefabs containing a VMB in the whole project.
    You may also specify folder locations to narrow down your search.


    In the
    following task you have to fix all issues in the currently opened scene and fix
    all issues on the <b>Test Validation Prefab</b> that lies in the project.


    If
    the Validator View displays a ! symbol and has no option to auto fix the issue
    your manual work is required.'
