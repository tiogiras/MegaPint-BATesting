  taskName: Runtime Screenshots 1
  taskDescription: 'Like the last task you need to take 4 screenshots during runtime.
    One of each asset group. But in contrast to the previous task you will now be
    using the Screenshot tool of the MegaPint collection. In addition you are required
    to take a screenshot of your CameraCapture configuration with the window capture.


    Since
    it would not be very efficient to pause the game and click the render button
    on the CameraCapture component for each camera you should use the <b>Shortcut</b>
    function. Make sure your camera is setup to render with the shortcut and use
    F12 to take your desired screenshots.


    If the shortcut does not work in
    playmode have a look at the help section of the screenshot tool in the BaseWindow.


    The
    time of this task cannot be estimated autoamtically. Because of that you have
    to hit the <b>Finish All Goals</b> button once you are satisfied with your taken
    screenshots.'
