  taskDescription: 'Certain tasks require you to perform a certain action or do something
    in order to reach the goal of the task.


    When your task is inside a predefined
    scene, unity will automatically load the needed scene once you press the start
    button. A timer will appear to count your needed time in the task. <b>Please
    always pause the timer when you need a break from your active task.</b>


    The
    task will automatically detect when the goal has been reached.


    The test
    can be advanced once all goals are met.'
