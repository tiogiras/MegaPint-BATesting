  taskName: Test Procedure II
  taskDescription: 'Certain tasks require you to perform a certain action or do something
    in order to reach the goal of the task.


    When your task is inside a predefined
    scene, unity will automatically load the needed scene once you press the start
    button. A timer will appear to count your needed time in the task. <b>Please
    always pause the timer when you need a break from your active task.</b>


    Every
    goal you need to reach provides you with a hint. You can always read this hint
    by hovering over the hint label. Only use it when you cannot solve the goal by
    yourself.


    The task will automatically detect when the goal has been reached
    as long as this window stays open. <b>Therefor always keep this window open!</b>


    The
    test can be advanced once all goals are met.'
