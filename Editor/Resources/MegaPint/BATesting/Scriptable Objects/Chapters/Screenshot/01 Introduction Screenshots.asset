  taskName: Introduction Screenshots
  taskDescription: "The next chapter is about the <b>Screenshot</b> Tool of the MegaPint
    collection.\n\nThe package is used to take Screenshots inside of unity by either
    directly rendering any camera component or an opened editor window. \n\nIn the
    follwing task you will be required to use all of the functionality at least once.\n\n<b>Screenshots
    of Camera's</b>\nYou can add the CameraCapture component to any GameObject that
    contains a camera component. This component allows you to directly render what
    the camera is seeing. The advantage of this over a simple screenshot is, that
    you can manipulate the resolution, background and postprocessing of your screenshot
    directly on the camera GameObject.\n\n<b>Rendering an EditorWindow</b>\nYou can
    render a selected editor window with the <b>Window Capture</b> MenuItem. This
    window allows you to select an opened editor window, render it and export the
    rendered image.\n\n<b>Setting up camera's to render with the shortcut</b>\nIf
    your scene contains multiple camera's, for example if you want to take screenshots
    of your character from multiple angles while playing, you can configure the cameraCapture
    components to render when the F12 key is pressed. To configure the camera's you
    need to use the <b>Shortcut Capture</b> MenuItem."
